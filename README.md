# DataCamp-Data-Analyst-Professional-Practical-Exam
This repository includes all files and my submissions for the DataCamp Data Analyst Professional practical exam.

The certification is a two step process. You must first complete a written exam testing your knowledge on Data Analysis theories and coding questions. Once you
have passed the written exam you are then eligible to complete the practical.
